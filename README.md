# Mug
An Gui libary and wrapper based on SDL2
# Strength
- build in datatypes (Mug_Point, Mug_Line)
- always evolving in competent ways
- a big future ahead (Text builtin, shaders)
# Is Mug compatible with opengl?
we are planning to make it compatible opengl, as right now its not that compatible but can work via sdl2 itself
at this point you better use sdl2 and not mug
# what feactures upcoming?
(in order)
- text support
- hide flag on Mug structs
#How We handle new feactures?
When we still delevoping the feacture, we make an program using that espefic feacture and fix any bug, its a good form of feedback
another type of feedback is you, yes you, you can report issues, help on documentation and more!
